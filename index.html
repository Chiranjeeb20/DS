        <h1>Tanjiro Kamado</h1>
        <p><em><strong>Tanjiro Kamado (竈門 炭治郎)</strong> is the main protagonist of the prominent anime/manga series,<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9335498/">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a>. He is also the older brother of Nezuko Kamado and
            is the oldest child of the Kamado family. He is a Kanoe ranked Demon Slayer and a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. He became a Demon Slayer in order to find a way to turn Nezuko back into a human, and hunt down the demon who is

  <strong>
    <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
  </strong>
  <p>Tanjiro is a young boy who is short for his age, with rather tanned skin and an athletic physique. He possesses ruffled burgundy hair that casts notably dark shadows on itself, combed back to expose his forehead, and wide, dark eyes with white
    pupils that appear dark pink around the lower section of their irises.</p>
  <P>He also has a birthmark on the top left of his forehead, which originally looked somewhat like a graze until his fight with the Hand Demon during the Final Selection Arc, after which it appears more like a large, dark red scar. It is noted that
    his hands are visibly tougher than someone his ages should be as a result of his rigorous training under Sakonji Urokodaki.</P>
  <P>Tanjiro wears a checkered dark turquoise and black patterned haori over the standard Demon Hunter uniform, which consists of a dark brown gakuran jacket, a white belt around his waist and baggy pants that extend into tabi socks, as well as zōri
    and bands of white cloth wrapped around his calves. He also wears a pair of hanafuda earrings, decorated by a red sun symbol, and carries a large wooden box on his back, where his sister sleeps during the day.</P>

  <strong>
    <h3>POWERS AND ABILITIES</h3>
  </strong>
  <P><em>Before becoming a Demon Slayer.</em></P>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hard Skull:</strong> Tanjiro has a hard skull he inherited from his mother. His head is very durable to the point in a single headbutt, it's physically strong enough to cause immediate damage to his opponents. One example is where he
      manages to stun Sanemi, the Wind Hashira.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Sense of Smell:</strong> Tanjiro possesses a sense of smell bordering on superhuman territory. Even before becoming a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro was known in a village as the boy who has an extremely strong sense of smell equivalent to
        that of hounds, bears and sharks etc.. He is able to pick up even the most subtle of scents and track their location with terrifying accuracy over long distances. It is strong enough for him to smell the 'opening thread', the slight pause in
        an enemy's movement which allows him an opening in which to strike.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Strength:</strong> After his training at Mount Sagiri, Tanjiro has gained superhuman arm and leg strength and has demonstrated a great use of it, jumping over the humongous Hand Demon, and leaping over buildings
        effortlessly. Tanjiro also casually broke Genya's arm and shattered Inosuke's ribs and sent him flying all with a single punch. With his katana, he could slice through gigantic boulders and entire trees. While training, Tanjiro is capable of
        doing hundreds of push-ups at once along with a plethora of other strength-related exercises. When he was posing as a courtesan, he was shown to carry dozens of large boxes easily and when he was angered, he ripped off an Upper Rank's leg.
        When he was training with Gyomei Himejima, he was tasked with lifting 3 enormous logs on his back and push a boulder through town. He later managed to cut off Akaza's head, a feat which even Kyojruo couldn't accomplish.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Immense Stamina & Endurance:</strong> Tanjiro has incredible stamina and endurance, even before he became a Demon Slayer, showed when he had to train in a mountain will little to no oxygen for many days, dodging booby traps, running
        and traversing through it up and down, and improving his swordsmanship skills and physique all while under these harsh conditions. His stamina and endurance was further improved having mastered.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Concentration:</strong> Constant (・ Zen Shūchū Jōchū?), allowing him to exert himself physically 24/7. He was able to rejoin the fight against Daki and Gyutaro despite him nearly crossing his life limit just minutes prior. His
        stamina was increased even further after he mastered the Hinokami Kagura, the same Breathing Style which allowed his sickly father to dance till dawn in the snow while barely clothed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Combined Breathstyles:</strong> Tanjiro combines Water Breathing and Hinokami Kagura together. This allowed a fatigued Tanjiro to move quickly to save Hinatsuru from Gyutaro. He would later used this these combined breathingstyles
        again during the Infinity Castle Arc to slay dozens of demons.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Recovery Breathing:</strong> A technique developed by Tanjiro that allows him to recover from fatigue and stiff muscles that prevent his body from moving, which he uses to overcome the whiplash of using Hinokami Kagura techniques
        twice in a row.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Demon Slayer Mark:</strong> Tanjiro awakens his mark for the first time while fighting Upper Rank Six, Gyutaro, and once again against the split forms of Hantengu, the Upper Rank Four. Later, the mark reappears during his rematch
        against Upper Rank 3, Akaza. In his marked state, Tanjiro's strength, speed, and reaction time increase drastically. In his fight with Akaza, after gaining access to the Transparent World in addition to his Demon Slayer mark, Tanjiro can move
        fast enough to cut off Akaza's head without giving him any time to react, a move which would've killed Akaza if it wasn't for him overcoming his weakness to Nichirin Sword decapitation. However, it should be noted Akaza's compass detection
        ability relied on him sensing battle spirit from his opponent, and Tanjiro was able to show no battle spirit while performing this attack. The drawback to his marked state is that Tanjiro can only enter it on rare occasions, and he can only
        use it for a very short period since it causes exhaustion to his body as proven in his battles against the Upper Ranks.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Repetitive Action:</strong> A technique practiced by few members in the Corps, it allows a person to achieve the same effects as Total Concentration Breathing by using repeating pre-set movements or remembering intense feelings to
        open the five senses and raise their concentration, drawing out the physical powers of the body for a long extended period. It is possible to use both Repetitive Action and Total Concentration Breathing simultaneously, granting the user
        immense strength able to rival Upper Rank demons. Tanjiro learned this technique after consulting Genya Shinazugawa. He raises his concentration to its maximum limits by remembering the faces of his loved ones and repeatedly recalling Kyojuro
        Rengoku's phrase "Set your heart ablaze."</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3>WATER BREATHING</h3>
  <P>
    Taught to him by Sakonji, a previous Water Hashira and, Water Breathing Cultivator. This was Tanjiro's initial breathing style before he switches to the Hinokami Kagura, a breathing style taught to him by his father during his childhood, which he
    states is more suited to him. However, during the course where he used Water Breathing, he has become extremely proficient, enabling him to take on two members of the Twelve Kizuki, Rui and Enmu.

  <h3>HINOKAMI KAGURA</h3>
  <p>
    During his near-death experience in his battle with Rui, Tanjiro awakened this in a memory of his father teaching him this breathing style. At that time, Tanjiro's body was not physically suited to the strain using the breathing style took on
    him, but through many adversities, he finally managed to master it. When Tanjiro fully witnessed the Thirteenth Form performed by Yoriichi Tsugikuni and gained consciousness, he awakened the Hinokami Kagura into the legendary <strong>Sun
      Breathing.</strong>
